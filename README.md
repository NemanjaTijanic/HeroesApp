# Heroes App
**Introduction**

This is a program that stores information about playable characters from Heroes of the Storm. Part of the data is gathered from the website heroesofthestorm.com. The program gives the user the opportunity to view all characters, find specific ones through filtering or create new ones. It also offers the possibility to choose two heroes, and get the result of the fight between them. Written using Java programming language.

## Specifics

The purpose of the app is to provide the user with all the essential information about the characters from the game. The user is given four options. 
With the first option, all heroes that are currently loaded in the database are displayed, as well as any essential information related to them. Another option is for the user to enter the ID of one of the heroes and see all available information. 

The third possibility allows the user to get information about a hero not currently in the database by entering their name, and allowing the app to integrate the new hero to the database by scraping all vital information about them from the website. 
And the final option is a fight between any two heroes, where the user enters their IDs, and gets an estimate of the outcome of the fight between them.
